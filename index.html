    <h1>Ancient India</h1>
    <h2>Gupta Empire</h2>
    <p>
    The Indus Civilization had huge citadels, or a fortified area or wall. Citadels are believed to have been the center of government, a place to lead religious ceremonies, or both.
 On the Arabian Sea, there is a statue of Shiva.
The Indians believed that Siddartha sat down under the Bodhi Tree, or the tree of knowledge. After meditating for 49 nights and days, he understood the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Then he became the enlightened one, and became Buddha.
In Sanchi, India there were many stupas, or Buddhist commemorative, burial grounds.
The Gupta Empire built the Iron Pillar of Delhi. It was a 23 foot high column made out of a single piece of iron. It stood for 1500 years before rusting.

The Indian civilization was separated from the rest of Asia by the Himalayas, and the hindu kush mountains. 

The Indus river was a key part of Ancient India. The Sarawasti river intersected with the Indus River, and it was a great place to build towns and villages. After the Indus civilization died out the Ganges river was the center of the Indian Civilization.
 	The Indus Valley civilization had two great cities named Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. These ancient cities were discovered in the 1920s. These cities provided a surplus of food.

				Gupta Empire
India broke into smaller kingdoms after the end of the Maurya empire. Armies kept trying to invade India.
 500 years after the Mauryas,  Chandra Gupta I, the first Gupta emperor, was named the Maurya emperor, Chandragupta. 
The Gupta empire was next to the Ganges River. 
Chandra Gupta reigned from 320 CE to 335 CE. Later, Samudra Gupta, Chandra Gupta’s son, conquered most of the small kingdoms. 

Chandra Gupta and Samudra Gupta tried to bring peace and prosperity to India. Unlike the Maurya empire, the Guptas left big decisions to the local leaders. The last Gupta emperor died in 540 CE.
The Guptas were skilled at art and literature. 
The Guptas practiced Hinduism. Literature flourished in the Gupta empire. 
Their greatest writer and poet was named Kalidasa. He wrote plays and poetry in a language called Sanskrit. 
A common form of literature was fables. One Indian fable was that two frogs had jumped into a bucket of milk and could not jump out. One of the frogs gave up on hope and drowned, while the other eventually churned the milk into butter, and jumped out with ease. 
The moral was that you should keep trying even though things might seem hopeless. 
Also, music and dancing was very popular in the Gupta period. Dancers made routines based on Hindu folklore. Musicians played instruments like stringed instruments and drums. 
Indian drama combined traditional stories, dances and singing. Participants wore makeup, and wore costumes. 
A form of the game of chess was invented in the Gupta period. 
In this time period Hindus and Buddhists built monasteries and temples. Stonecutters carved rock and they showed good engineering skills. 
Right after the Gupta dynasty Indians started carving temples and monasteries into cliffs and rocks. 
The rock-cut shrines of Ellora showcase brilliant sculptures and paintings. 
Through trade and invasion, Guptas learned that the Greeks and Persians had some great teachings. 
This led Indian scholars to advance concepts in math and science. Indians made the concept of zero, as both a numeral/symbol, and a number. This was a huge advancement into the decimal system. 
These advancements are what we call, Hindu-Arabian, or Arabian numerals today. With the introduction of zero and these numerals, multiplication and division became much easier. 
This opened new pathways in math, like algebra. 
Aryabatha was a very important Indian astronomer, who in 499 CE, wrote books about arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry. 
Aryabatha's work later helped people understand how to calculate the area of triangles and the volume of spheres. 
Aryabatha was the first astronomer to say that the Earth rotates on its axis to make day and night. 
He also learned that the Moon shines because sunlight is reflecting off of it. 
Indian doctors made progress in medicine science as well. They created a system of medicine known as Ayurveda. 
Ancient Ayurvedic medical textbooks explain many different diseases and how to treat them. It also explains how to make medicines out of plants, animal parts, and minerals. 
Gupta artisans developed a way of extracting metal from ore and using it for other objects. This is called metallurgy. 
The Iron Pillar of Delhi is a great example of how they used metallurgy. The pillar was made out of one single huge piece of iron. It has stood for over 1500 years without rusting.

    <h2>Origins and Beliefs of Buddhism</h2>
    <p>
Around 600 BCE many Indians left their homes and families. They did this because they wanted to become wandering teachers of philosophies of life.  There were two well known teachers, Siddhartha Gautama, and Mahariva. Siddhartha became known as the Buddha. Maharive became the founder of Jainism. Both Hinduism and Jainism spread across India. One of the teachers was born around 500 BCE in what is now called Nepal now. He was raised with wealth and luxury. According to a legend, her teacher Siddhartha Gautama's mother had a dream. She dreamed that an elephant came to her from heaven. Based on the dream a prophet predicted that the child would grow up to be a holy man. This disturbed his father since he wanted Siddhartha to be a ruler. To keep Siddhartha from becoming a holy man, his father protected him from anything unpleasant, dangerous, and disturbing.  Buddhists like the idea that Hindus had consequences but they did not like the idea of a permanent soul. Buddhist traditions say that one day siddhartha was about 29 years old, he rode out of the palace without any guards. Siddhartha saw an old toothless man leaning on a stick when he got out. He realized that he was shrunken by disease. Then he also saw a sick man. Then, Siddhartha saw a holy man who was homeless. Yet he was still content. Siddhartha wanted to try to find the same state of peace as the holy man showed. Siddhartha cut his hair and traded his rich clothing for a simple cloak from a religious trader. Sidartha wore bad clothes and did not eat (fasted) he lost weight and became weak and then he realized this was not the way. He wanted to find the truth about life, suffering, and death. He sought Hindu gurus to teach him. The gurus taught meditation techniques and different teachings of the Upanishads which he was to later build upon with his own insight. Then for five years Siddhartha wore scratchy clothes and fasted for a long period of time.  He lost weight and became very weak. After six years of self-denial he realized that  going to such extremes was not the path to truth. Siddhartha renewed his search. According to the legend Siddhartha meditated under the tree for 49 days and nights. The tree became known as the Bodhi tree. During this time he came to understand and awareness of suffering. He understood the cycle of birth. Siddhartha reaches enlightenment, life free of perfect wisdom. This is when Siddhartha became known as Buddha. According to Buddhist texts the Buddha had freed himself from the “wheel of existence.” For the next 45 years Buddha traveled across India sharing his message. Buddha died at about the age of 80 years old according to this legend. Buddha accepted the Hindu idea of karma, the idea that a person's actions have consequences in this or in future lives. However, Buddha did not accept the Hindu idea of a permanent soul. He believed that a “self”, might be reborn in a new body, but he thought that “self” was an illusion. Buddha believed that when you reached enlightenment, “self” would cease to exist. Buddha moved even further from Hindu beliefs. One example is that Buddha didn’t believe in a god. He also didn’t accept specific varna roles. He also believed that good and bad actions were more important than social roles. Like Hinduism,  his teachings supported ethical and moral society. Buddha lived in both types of lives. In great pleasure, and poverty. Neither way of life had led Buddha to enlightenment. Buddha advised people to follow the middle way. Following the Middle Way meant accepting all four truths. The first noble truth consists of suffering and birth. The second truth was that wanting and desiring things for one self causes suffering.

        he embraced Buddhism and ruled with compassion and tolerance. He built stupas and erected stone pillars inscribed with edicts promoting nonviolence and respect for other religions. 
        Asoka’s leadership and policies continue to inspire leaders today.
